# 🖥️ Windows 11 Unattended Script

A fully automated, Windows 11 installation using a single `autounattend.xml` file.

This project eliminates setup prompts, removes bloat, disables Microsoft Edge, applies tweaks, sets wallpaper, and configures both machine-wide and user-level post-install tasks — all embedded within the XML file itself.

> ⚠️ Power users only — modifies system-level features. Test in a VM before using on physical hardware.
